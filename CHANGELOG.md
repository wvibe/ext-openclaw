# Changelog

**Why this looks different:** the project was renamed from **Clawdis → Clawdbot**. To make the transition clear, releases now use **date-based versions** (`YYYY.M.D`) and the changelog is **compressed** into milestone summaries. Full detail still lives in git history and the docs.

## Unreleased

### Fixes
- Android: tapping the foreground service notification brings the app to the front. (#179) — thanks @Syhids
- Cron tool passes `id` to the gateway for update/remove/run/runs (keeps `jobId` input). (#180) — thanks @adamgall


## 2026.1.4

### Highlights
- Rename completion: all CLIs, paths, bundle IDs, env vars, and docs standardized on **Clawdbot**.
- Agent-to-agent relay: `sessions_send` ping‑pong with `REPLY_SKIP` plus announce step with `ANNOUNCE_SKIP`.
- Gateway quality-of-life: config hot reload, port config support, and Control UI base paths.
- Sandbox additions: per-session Docker sandbox with hardened limits + optional sandboxed Chromium.
- New node capability: `location.get` across macOS/iOS/Android (CLI + tools).
- Models CLI: scan OpenRouter free models (tools/images), manage aliases/fallbacks, and show last-used model in status.

### Breaking
- Tool names drop the `clawdbot_` prefix (`browser`, `canvas`, `nodes`, `cron`, `gateway`).
- Bash tool removes node-pty `stdinMode: "pty"` support (use tmux for real TTYs).
- Primary session key is fixed to `main` (or `global` for global scope).

### Fixes
- Doctor migrates legacy Clawdis config/service installs and normalizes sandbox Docker names.
- Doctor checks sandbox image availability and offers to build or fall back to legacy images.
- Presence beacons keep node lists fresh; Instances view stays accurate.
- Block streaming/chunking reliability (Telegram/Discord ordering, fewer duplicates).
- WhatsApp GIF playback for MP4-based GIFs.
- Onboarding + Control UI basePath handling fixes and UI polish.
- Clearer tool summaries, reduced log noise, and safer watchdog/queue behavior.
- Canvas host watcher resilience; build and packaging edge cases cleaned up.

### Docs
- Sandbox setup, hot reload, port config, and session announce step coverage.
- Skills and onboarding clarifications + additional examples.

- Discord/Telegram require `enabled: true` in config when using env tokens.
- Routing `allowFrom`/mention settings moved to per-surface group settings.

### Highlights
- Pi-only agent path and web-only gateway workflow.
